        <h2>The Allegory of the Farm</h2>
        <img src="j+n.jpg" alt="Split image showing Joseph Stalin and Napoleon the pig from Animal Farm" class="content-image">
        <p>
            George Orwell’s book <em>Animal Farm</em> is not just another novel about animals, but rather, it's a book all about politcs, and allegorys  regarding the Russian Revolution, and it's resulting effects and rise of the Soviet Union. The main area of the story, the farm, serves as a model for society, where the animals overthrow their human "owner", Mr. Jones, in hopes of creating an equal space for all.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>However,</strong> the motive quickly shifts to display how power can corrupt us all. The pigs, led by the leader Napoleon, slowly abuses their power, betraying the very principles of the revolution.

    <section id="banning">
        <h2>Should This Book Be Banned?</h2>
        <img src="images.jpg" alt="A stack of frequently banned books including Animal Farm, The Handmaid's Tale, and Fahrenheit 451" class="content-image">
        <p>
            Throughout history, <em>Animal Farm</em> has faced censorship all around the world, including the USSR and the United States. Critics have argued that the book causes negative reactions, and forms bias's. People also said <i>Animal Farm<i> is too political for young readers, or religiously offensive due to the humanizing of pigs.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Conversely,</strong> banning this book may have a negative effect to education. The argument for keeping the book in curriculums is robust. It does not promote communism, but rather, it serves as a critique of how socialist mindsets can be heavily modified by authoritarian dictators. As evidence of the book's intent to expose, rather than promote, tyranny, Orwell writes:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others."
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>Therefore in my personal opinion, </strong> the book should not be banned. To remove Orwells book is to remove a large tool for understanding how language can be modifited to control society.
        </p>

    <section id="importance">
        <h2>The Importance of the Novel Today</h2>
        <p>
            The relevance of <em>Animal Farm</em> extends quite far beyond the context of the 20th century. <strong>Primarily,</strong> the book serves as a timeless warning about the unstableness of modern day democracy and the importance of being educated.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>For instance,</strong> the character of Squealer represents the <i>propaganda</i> machine. He convinces the other animals that their memories are faulty, and practically rewriting history to suit Napoleon’s every want and need. This mirrors modern concerns regarding "fake news" and media manipulation especally news channels or other political events.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>In conclusion,</strong> Orwell’s book Animal Farm is very worth reading. It teaches us that freedom is not lost all at once, but slowly crumbles through the modification of laws and truth based on selfish desire.
